# About me

My name is Javier Montes Gómez, and I am preparing to transition into cybersecurity after 10 years working in international EU-funded projects, including digital development and GDPR-related initiatives.

I am passionate about:
- Linux and open source
- Privacy and ethical technology
- Learning by doing
- Hands-on cybersecurity

This folder introduces who I am and the purpose of this repository.
